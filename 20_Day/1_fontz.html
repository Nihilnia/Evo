    <h3>Nihil</h3>
    <div id="gmNihil">I been in a rut
        Ducked off from the sun
        Bit my gun
        With my black gold gums
        I'm no fun
        I'm no fun
        Blood run marathons
        Down my chest (down my chest)
        I'm a mess
        Ain't nobody gonna clean up
        Bulletproof your limousine
        I been in the
        Market for a brand new soul
        Daddy hit a brand new low
        Better yet another agoraphobic episode
        Here we go again here we go again here we go
        Cut me up to little pieces like you're Ed Pope
        Let me rest in pieces underneath the floorboards
        Planet on fire no fucks given
        I'mma let us all die, let us all die
        Really I
        Haven't been good to myself
        And you haven't been good to me
        I haven't been good to myself
        And lately, you haven't been good to me
        Lately I decided I'mma stay alive
        I just wanna live and see society die
        Lookin' around and all I see is at the end of the line
        I see a dystopia (dystopia)
        Evil all over and no one is safe
        Nihilist I am the finest though I don't align with it
        We're all to blame
        Keep on denying it
        You think that I need you
        I'll show you I'm fine
        You think that I need you
        You think that I need you
        You think that I need you
        You think that I need you
        You think that I need you (need you)
        I'll show you I'm fine (I'm fine)</div>
